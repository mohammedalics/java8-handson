Java 8 hands on
===============

**Lambda Expression**

 - short form replacement for anonymous classes. 
 - simplifying the implementation of functional interfaces. 
 - functional interfaces: Interfaces with only one method declaration. 
 - functional interfaces were implementing using 
	 - A class that implements this interface. 
	 - anonymous class for that interface. 
 - lambda expression is designed to support multicore processor architecture (donâ€™t know how).   

**benefits of Lambda** 

 - concise implementation 
 - Method references and constructor references. 
 - Reduced runtime overhead compared to anonymous classes

**Syntax**

> (formal parameter list) -> { expression or statements }

 - A lambda expression has an implicit target type associated with it because an interface type is not explicitly specified.
 - The target type of a lambda conversion must be a functional interface.
 - Lambda expressions can be used only in contexts in which the target type can be inferred. Such contexts are:
	 - A variable declaration
	 - An assignment
	 - A return statement
	 - An array initializer
	 - Method or constructor arguments
	 - A lambda expression body
	 - A ternary conditional expression
	 - A cast expression
 - A lambda expression body must not throw more exceptions than specified in the throws clause of the functional interface method. If a lambda expression body throws an exception, the throws clause of the functional interface method must declare the same exception type or its supertype.
